When you feed (run) the first region, you get `42` and `~3` as results.

When you feed the second region, you get `47`.

When you feed the third, you get `1234567890`.

The main point is when you feed the lines `a` and `b`. At `a` you get the last evaluated 'X' value, that is `1234567890`. Same goes for `b` and the last value of `Y`, `47`.
